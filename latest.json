   "general_advisory": "In the current scenario of weather in the state, farmers have to manage their agriculture for the next two weeks. The following recommendations are made: - Farmers who have not yet planted nurseries of longer duration varieties of paddy can still plant nurseries in eastern Uttar Pradesh for transplanting through the Sanda method. In view of the present condition of the monsoon and the high temperature, farmers should sow Kharif crops and plant paddy nurseries only after June 20. If paddy nurseries have not yet been planted, medium-term (20 to 30 days) and short-term (5 to 20 days) nursery of the species at least. Use only treated seeds for sowing Kharif crops. If the seed is not treated, then sow it only after treating it. Place paddy nurseries at different time intervals to avoid vagaries of weather. Farmers can sow short duration varieties of paddy directly. When the temperature of the water in the nursery rises, remove the water from the beds before noon and irrigate again in the evening. To get more production of pigeon pea when weather and temperature are favorable, sow on ridges by making ridges and ridges. Prune the finished urad and moong beans as soon as possible. In view of the priorities of the government, importance should be given to the cultivation of coarse grains such as maize, sorghum, millet, ragi, semolina, cowpea, etc. Cultivation of these crops can also protect them from the vagaries of weather.",
